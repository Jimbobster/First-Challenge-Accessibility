# First-Challenge-Accessibility
## Description
I built this project to update the accessibility features of the website, enabling customers to use screen readers, braille keyboards and video captions.
When a user clicks on an image or icon, then they will see alternative text to describe each image and icon.
When a website visitor clicks on a link, then they will be directed to that particular section of the page.
